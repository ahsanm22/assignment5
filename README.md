# Project Title
- **Data 1202: Data Analytics Tools - Lab 2**
  - The lab focuses on using Python and Pandas for data preprocessing, emphasizing methods for importing data from SQL databases and executing SQL queries within a Python environment.

## Getting Started
- **Short Description**: The lab introduces the concept of preprocessing data with Python (Pandas) after importing from a SQL database. It aims to familiarize participants with connection methods to databases and the execution of SQL queries using Python.
- **Prerequisites**: Although not explicitly mentioned, it’s implied that participants should have basic Python knowledge, familiarity with Pandas, and understanding of SQL databases.
- **Installing**: Specific installation instructions are not provided in the shared content. Generally, prerequisites for such tasks would include having Python and Pandas installed, alongside any necessary SQL database drivers or connectors (e.g., SQLAlchemy for database connections).

## Running the Tests
- **Breakdown of Tests**: The lab seems to incorporate practice questions or exercises, as hinted at in the table of contents, which likely serve to test the participants' understanding and skills in executing the tasks taught. Specific details on the tests are not provided in the overview.

## Deployment
- Deployment aspects are not covered in the brief overview provided. In educational settings like this, deployment typically refers to the application of learned skills to real-world scenarios or projects, which might be discussed in later sections or separate materials.

## Author
- The author is not specified in the initial overview. Educational materials often have their authorship noted in course syllabi or introductory sections.

## License
- License information is not provided in the brief content overview. Educational materials might be licensed under various terms that dictate how they can be used or distributed, details of which could be found in course documentation or initial notebook cells.

## Acknowledgement
- Acknowledgements, if any, are not mentioned in the initial content overview. It’s common in academic and educational projects to acknowledge contributions, data sources, or reference materials, potentially noted towards the end of the notebook or in course materials.

This overview suggests the Python code serves an instructional purpose, particularly in demonstrating how to work with SQL databases through Python for data preprocessing.
